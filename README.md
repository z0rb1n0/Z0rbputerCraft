# Z0rbputerCraft


Set of Lua libraries and scripts to automate operations with ComputerCraft-based scripts.


The filesystem structure is a rudimentary version of what you'd find in a unix system:

/lib contains custom APIs (the "libraries")
/bin contains the programs.

The startup file adds /bin to the path




Installation/update:


From the CC console:


/update_zc
reboot (or run /startup if you don't feel like rebooting)
